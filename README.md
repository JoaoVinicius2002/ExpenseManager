# Expense Manager
This project was developed in order to apply some key .NET Core concepts, such as models, views, and controllers with it's get and post actions.
I used the Latest LTS version of .NET Core that is .NET Core 5, I also used bootstrap for this simple design, since it was not the focus of this project.
For the database, the Entity Framework Core ORM was used, with de Code First approach.
It was really nice to build this app, in the Expense CRUD was added a property named "Expense Type" that can be created and updated in another CRUD.

Thanks for reading, 
It's a simple project that was made easily just to execute some .NET Core concepts.
